1. Cut the fish into small cubes, place in a glass bowl and cover with cold water and 1 tablespoon of salt, cover and refrigerate while you prepare the onions and juice the limes.
2. Rub the thin onion slices with 1/2 tablespoon of salt and rinse in cold water.
3. Rinse the fish to remove the salt
4. Place the cubes of fish, half of the sliced onions, chopped ginger, hot peppers, and the chopped cilantro in a glass bowl and pour the lime juice over the ingredients. Sprinkle with a little bit of salt. To minimize the acidity of the limes you can put a few ice cubes in the mix.
5. Cover and marinate for about 15-20 minutes.
6. Taste the ceviche mixed lime juice and add additional salt if needed.
7. Use a spoon to place the ceviche in each serving bowl, add additional sliced onions to each bowl, and if needed, more sliced hot peppers.
